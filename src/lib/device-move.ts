// Moving a device's object tree to a new device id — the one-time step of an id-rule change.
// Ported from ioBroker.homeconnect `src/lib/device-move.ts` (1.24.0), itself ported from ioBroker.yamaha
// `src/lib/lifecycle/device-move.ts` (3.0.0); the same mechanics in all three adapters.

import { ID_SCHEME } from "./device-id";

/*
 * ioBroker has no rename: an object that should live under another id is written there and the old
 * one deleted. What the user attached to the tree has to be carried by hand, or it is lost with the
 * old objects. Carried here:
 *
 * - every object (device, channels, states) with its whole `common` — the recording settings in
 *   `common.custom` included — and its `native`;
 * - every value, with its `ack`, `ts`, `lc` and `q`, so nothing reads as changed;
 * - aliases whose target lies in the tree (`alias.*`, `common.alias.id`, plain or read/write);
 * - the continuity of recorded history: an enabled recording without an alias id of its own gets
 *   the OLD id as `aliasId` — influxdb, history and sql then store and query the series under the
 *   id it has always had.
 *
 * The rooms and functions (enum members) are NOT carried here: deleting the old tree removes its ids
 * from every enum, written back from the adapter's enum cache, and would take an id written before it
 * away again. The caller deletes through the fleet helper `moveAllWithEnums` (`enum-carry.ts`), which
 * reads the memberships first, deletes, and writes the new ids last — the ids below the root deepest
 * first, the root last. Until that delete the old device object carries `native.movingTo` as a
 * journal, and an interrupted move is completed on the next start.
